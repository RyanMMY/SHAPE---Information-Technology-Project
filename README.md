Description: In this study, I carry out sentiment analysis in tweets and then compare three supervised machine learning methods: Naive Bayes Classifier, Logistic Regression, and Linear Support Vector Classifier. After comparing their accuracy, recall and f1-score, the linear support vector classifier has the most obvious performance advantage in tweetsâ€™s sentiment analysis.
